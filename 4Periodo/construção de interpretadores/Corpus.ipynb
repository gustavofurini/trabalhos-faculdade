NLP techniques can be used by psychotherapists, coaches, trainers, managers, sales people, teachers and more, with the aim of changing one’s thoughts and behaviours to help achieve the results the individual desires.', 'There are several definitions of NLP. Each of the founders of this movement offered their own version. The one I particularly resonate with is:', '“The process of creating models of human excellence in which usefulness – not truthfulness – is the most important criterion for success.”  – Steve and Connirae Andreas', 'NLP is short for Neuro Linguistic Programming. NLP is based on language processing, but should not be confused with natural language processing, which shares the same acronym.Neuro-Linguistic Programming covers three areas:', 'The popularity of Neuro-Linguistic Programming or NLP has become widespread since it first appeared in the 1970s. At the time, mathematician Richard Bandler and philologist John Grinder asked themselves a simple but fascinating question: “What exactly is the difference between a person who is only competent in one area and another who achieves excellent performance in the same area?”.They believed it was possible to identify the thought patterns and behaviours of successful individuals that they could model and teach others.Despite the lack of empirical evidence to support it, Bandler and Grinder published two books, The Structure of Magic I and II, and NLP took off. Its popularity was partly due to its versatility in addressing the many different problems people face.Through the modelling process that the two creators of NLP developed, patterns of good intra- and interpersonal functioning are identified, which can then be transferred to other people, like technological know-how.Based on this approach, NLP has developed continuously and has now become a synthesis of many disciplines offering systematic and effective tools for developing competencies in all areas of professional and personal life.NLP’s uses include the treatment of phobias and anxiety disorders, improving work performance or personal happiness.', 'Like any other theory, NLP is based on a philosophy of principles that focus on learning and facilitating mental processes, behaviour, communication and change. When you come into contact with the presuppositions of NLP, it is not necessary to take them as true or to prove their futility.The list of NLP principles is long, but I will detail only 5 of the ones I particularly resonate with, and the rest I will just mention.', 'Humans cannot know reality itself and each of us has a model of the world called a “map”. What we know are perceptions of reality. These perceptions areNeurolinguistic “maps” created through representational systems (senses): Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, Olfactory, Gustatory (VAKOG).Our maps contain elements of the present (now and here), the past (memory) and the future (imagination). These maps determine our behaviour. Therefore, we can act on the mechanisms of perception to be more adaptive, i.e. we can act on the present, past and future through the processes of memory and imagination because they use the same nerve circuits.It is extremely important to remember that “people react and respond according to their inner maps” and no individual map is more “real”, more “right”, more “true”, more “objective” than another map.The complexity and uniqueness of our maps makes each of us unique!', 'Throughout our lives we go through different experiences and thus gather resources that help us in solving problems that arise. If we fail to bring out these resources within ourselves, then we can transfer them from others. The idea of transferring resources from other people is the basis for NLP.', 'Flexibility and creativity are the two elements that support this principle. NLP develops both of them and forces you to constantly find solutions.', 'Each person is responsible for their own states and the results they achieve. By taking responsibility for our own lives, we get out from under the influence of dependence on other people and create a healthy basis for a good management of our personal existence.', 'Human behaviour is determined by the pattern of the world on which it is based, so we each choose only those solutions of which we are aware at a given time in a given situation or at a given moment in our lives.The behaviour we are talking about might not be acceptable in the given context, but there are situations where it is desirable. For example, the ability to hurt or even kill someone is not socially acceptable behaviour, but in war or for self-defence it may be desirable.This principle facilitates understanding, empathy and forgiveness.', 'NLP is a vast field. As such, NLP practitioners use many different techniques including the following:', 'Anchoring – Turning sensory experiences into triggers for specific emotional states.Anchoring is a natural process by which any element of an experience (Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, Olfactory, Gustatory = VAKOG) can create (recall) the whole experience. The notion of anchor resides in the fact that our subjective experiences are represented, stored, processed and interpreted in the form of VAKOG or VAKAd (Ad = Auditory digital) schemes. In other words, an anchor is a small part of a pleasant or unpleasant experience which, accessed, facilitates our access to that experience.', 'Exercise “Self-anchoring”:', 'You’re completely related. Now accentuate the representations: make the image brighter, more colourful, bigger, increase the volume of the sounds, make them louder, intensify the bodily sensations, prolong them. Change the representations in such a way as to reach that maximum of living.', 'The practitioner synchronizes with another person by matching their physical behaviors to improve communication and response through empathy.', '“Creating rapport involves creating trust, harmony and cooperation in a communicative relationship.” Robert Dilts ', 'Rapport is essential in effective communication. Establishing rapport involves finding elements in the two communicators’ “maps” that overlap and are common. It is however much more than identifying the common parts, rapport is simultaneous communication at the unconscious and conscious level, at the verbal, para-verbal and non-verbal level. In many ways rapport is like a dance, an ongoing guidance between two partners, the only difference being that in the case of dance the one leading the process does not change. In rapport, both “partners” in communication take turns in taking the role of guide, of leader.', 'Rapport is a process that has several stages:', 'This process involves identifying and recognising the person’s behaviours in communication. The term pacing can be applied at both the relationship and task level. The aim is to understand the person’s model of the world and to create the conditions for guiding that person towards a certain destination.', 'Leading involves trying to influence the person to make a decision to change. In practice, this leading is never taken separately from pacing, as it is an important part of the rapport. When pacing, you are trying to get into the other person’s skin, to experience what it is like to live in their model of the world. You communicate with him through his language and think like him. When you drive, you try to influence him to a new behaviour and a new way of thinking. Leading is only possible through precise pacing.', 'Sometimes, it is just as useful to “mismatch” to “break” the rapport. It is the exact opposite process of tuning. Why would we want to do this? Mismatching and breaking rapport can be useful to a manager who has no time to waste in a conversation with a particular person. Or vice versa – a subordinate who has had enough of the conversation with the boss. Once again, watch out for the ecological framework!

This popularity may be due to the fact that practitioners can use it in many different areas and contexts.However, the general ideas on which NLP is based, and the lack of an official body to monitor its use, mean that the methods and quality of practice can vary considerably. In any case, no clear and impartial evidence has yet emerged to support its effectiveness.For these reasons, good marketing may also have contributed to the widespread popularity of NLP, particularly in the commercial sector.Personally, I believe there are benefits to understanding and using certain NLP techniques in personal and professional life. I will mention a few general ones:Discovering the preferred types of communication, taking into account the VAKOG system, of the people around you (friends, colleagues, family) to know exactly how to speak “in their language”. You can discover how exactly to make them pay attention to what you say and how to make them more receptive to your messages, thus avoiding misunderstandings.Awareness of the link between your own emotions and success in life. Correctly identifying and managing your moods helps you to show confidence whenever needed.Setting goals that really matter to you and that are aligned with your values and skills, rather than goals “imposed” by others, so you can achieve them more easily.Learning to value yourself and discover your hidden talents.In conclusion, I recommend discovering for yourself whether NLP is right for you or not by attending a course, reading books or interacting with people who already apply NLP in their personal and/or professional lives.', 'Sources:NLP Practitioner course organised by Integrative NLP“Introduction to NLP by Joseph O’Conner and John Seymour“Coaching with NLP” by Joseph O’Conner and Adrea Lages', 'Your email address will not be published.

When we ask questions of these virtual assistants, NLP is what enables them to not only understand the user’s request, but to also respond in natural language. NLP applies both to written text and speech, and can be applied to all human languages. Other examples of tools powered by NLP include web search, email spam filtering, automatic translation of text or speech, document summarization, sentiment analysis, and grammar/spell checking. For example, some email programs can automatically suggest an appropriate reply to a message based on its content—these programs use NLP to read, analyze, and respond to your message.', 'There are several other terms that are roughly synonymous with NLP.

However, the major breakthroughs of the past few years have been powered by machine learning, which is a branch of AI that develops systems that learn and generalize from data. Deep learning is a kind of machine learning that can learn very complex patterns from large datasets, which means that it is ideally suited to learning the complexities of natural language from datasets sourced from the web.', 'Automate routine tasks: Chatbots powered by NLP can process a large number of routine tasks that are handled by human agents today, freeing up employees to work on more challenging and interesting tasks. For example, chatbots and Digital Assistants can recognize a wide variety of user requests, match them to the appropriate entry in a corporate database, and formulate an appropriate response to the user.', ' Improve search: NLP can improve on keyword matching search for document and FAQ retrieval by disambiguating word senses based on context (for example, “carrier” means something different in biomedical and industrial contexts), matching synonyms (for example, retrieving documents mentioning “car” given a search for “automobile”), and taking morphological variation into account (which is important for non-English queries).

With NLP, businesses are better able to analyze their data to help make the right decisions. Here are just a few examples of practical applications of NLP:', 'Machine learning models for NLP: We mentioned earlier that modern NLP relies heavily on an approach to AI called machine learning. Machine learning make predictions by generalizing over examples in a dataset. This dataset is called the training data, and machine learning algorithms train on this training data to produce a machine learning model that accomplishes a target task.', 'For example, sentiment analysis training data consists of sentences together with their sentiment (for example, positive, negative, or neutral sentiment). A machine-learning algorithm reads this dataset and produces a model which takes sentences as input and returns their sentiments. This kind of model, which takes sentences or documents as inputs and returns a label for that input, is called a document classification model. Document classifiers can also be used to classify documents by the topics they mention (for example, as sports, finance, politics, etc.).', 'Another kind of model is used to recognize and classify entities in documents. For each word in a document, the model predicts whether that word is part of an entity mention, and if so, what kind of entity is involved. For example, in “XYZ Corp shares traded for $28 yesterday”, “XYZ Corp” is a company entity, “$28” is a currency amount, and “yesterday” is a date. The training data for entity recognition is a collection of texts, where each word is labeled with the kinds of entities the word refers to. This kind of model, which produces a label for each word in the input, is called a sequence labeling model.', 'Sequence to sequence models are a very recent addition to the family of models used in NLP. A sequence to sequence (or seq2seq) model takes an entire sentence or document as input (as in a document classifier) but it produces a sentence or some other sequence (for example, a computer program) as output. (A document classifier only produces a single symbol as output). Example applications of seq2seq models include machine translation, which for example, takes an English sentence as input and returns its French sentence as output; document summarization (where the output is a summary of the input); and semantic parsing (where the input is a query or request in English, and the output is a computer program implementing that request).', 'Deep learning, pretrained models, and transfer learning: Deep learning is the most widely-used kind of machine learning in NLP. In the 1980s, researchers developed neural networks, in which a large number of primitive machine learning models are combined into a single network: by analogy with brains, the simple machine learning models are sometimes called “neurons.” These neurons are arranged in layers, and a deep neural network is one with many layers. Deep learning is machine learning using deep neural network models.', 'Because of their complexity, generally it takes a lot of data to train a deep neural network, and processing it takes a lot of compute power and time. Modern deep neural network NLP models are trained from a diverse array of sources, such as all of Wikipedia and data scraped from the web. The training data might be on the order of 10 GB or more in size, and it might take a week or more on a high-performance cluster to train the deep neural network. (Researchers find that training even deeper models from even larger datasets have even higher performance, so currently there is a race to train bigger and bigger models from larger and larger datasets).', 'The voracious data and compute requirements of Deep Neural Networks would seem to severely limit their usefulness. However, transfer learning enables a trained deep neural network to be further trained to achieve a new task with much less training data and compute effort. The simplest kind of transfer learning is called fine tuning. It consists simply of first training the model on a large generic dataset (for example, Wikipedia) and then further training (“fine-tuning”) the model on a much smaller task-specific dataset that is labeled with the actual target task. Perhaps surprisingly, the fine-tuning datasets can be extremely small, maybe containing only hundreds or even tens of training examples, and fine-tuning training only requires minutes on a single CPU. Transfer learning makes it easy to deploy deep learning models throughout the enterprise.', 'There is now an entire ecosystem of providers delivering pretrained deep learning models that are trained on different combinations of languages, datasets, and pretraining tasks. These pretrained models can be downloaded and fine-tuned for a wide variety of different target tasks.', 'Tokenization: Tokenization splits raw text (for example., a sentence or a document) into a sequence of tokens, such as words or subword pieces. Tokenization is often the first step in an NLP processing pipeline. Tokens are commonly recurring sequences of text that are treated as atomic units in later processing. They may be words, subword units called morphemes (for example, prefixes such as “un-“ or suffixes such as “-ing” in English), or even individual characters. ', 'Bag-of-words models: Bag-of-words models treat documents as unordered collections of tokens or words (a bag is like a set, except that it tracks the number of times each element appears). Because they completely ignore word order, bag-of-words models will confuse a sentence such as “dog bites man” with “man bites dog.” However, bag-of-words models are often used for efficiency reasons on large information retrieval tasks such as search engines. They can produce close to state-of-the-art results with longer documents.', 'Stop word removal: A “stop word” is a token that is ignored in later processing. They are typically short, frequent words such as “a,” “the,” or “an.” Bag-of-words models and search engines often ignore stop words in order to reduce processing time and storage within the database. Deep neural networks typically do take word-order into account (that is, they are not bag-of-words models) and do not do stop word removal because stop words can convey subtle distinctions in meaning (for example, “the package was lost” and “a package is lost” don’t mean the same thing, even though they are the same after stop word removal). ', 'Stemming and lemmatization: Morphemes are the smallest meaning-bearing elements of language. Typically morphemes are smaller than words. For example, “revisited” consists of the prefix “re-“, the stem “visit,” and the past-tense suffix “-ed.” Stemming and lemmatization map words to their stem forms (for example, “revisit” + PAST). Stemming and lemmatization are crucial steps in pre-deep learning models, but deep learning models generally learn these regularities from their training data, and so do not require explicit stemming or lemmatization steps.', 'Part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing: Part-of-speech (PoS) tagging is the process of labeling each word with its part of speech (for example, noun, verb, adjective, etc.). A Syntactic parser identifies how words combine to form phrases, clauses, and entire sentences. PoS tagging is a sequence labeling task, syntactic parsing is an extended kind of sequence labeling task, and deep neural Nntworks are the state-of-the-art technology for both PoS tagging and syntactic parsing. Before deep learning, PoS tagging and syntactic parsing were essential steps in sentence understanding. However, modern deep learning NLP models generally only benefit marginally (if at all) from PoS or syntax information, so neither PoS tagging nor syntactic parsing are widely used in deep learning NLP.', 'The NLP Libraries and toolkits are generally available in Python, and for this reason by far the majority of NLP projects are developed in Python. Python’s interactive development environment makes it easy to develop and test new code.', 'For processing large amounts of data, C++ and Java are often preferred because they can support more efficient code.', 'Here are examples of some popular NLP libraries. ', 'TensorFlow and PyTorch: These are the two most popular deep learning toolkits. They are freely available for research and commercial purposes. While they support multiple languages, their primary language is Python. They come with large libraries of prebuilt components, so even very sophisticated deep learning NLP models often only require plugging these components together. They also support high-performance computing infrastructure, such as clusters of machines with graphical processor unit (GPU) accelerators. They have excellent documentation and tutorials.', 'AllenNLP: This is a library of high-level NLP components (for example, simple chatbots) implemented in PyTorch and Python. The documentation is excellent.', 'HuggingFace: This company distributes hundreds of different pretrained Deep Learning NLP models, as well as a plug-and-play software toolkit in TensorFlow and PyTorch that enables developers to rapidly evaluate how well different pretrained models perform on their specific tasks.', 'Spark NLP: Spark NLP is an open source text processing library for advanced NLP for the Python, Java, and Scala programming languages. Its goal is to provide an application programming interface (API) for natural language processing pipelines. It offers pretrained neural network models, pipelines, and embeddings, as well as support for training custom models.

SpaCy is known to be highly intuitive and can handle many of the tasks needed in common NLP projects.
